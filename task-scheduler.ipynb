    ">These were the tasks that I planned to accomplish this Wednesday, November 16th. On Wednesdays the two tasks that I always have are the CS110 class, which always happens at fixed time at 14:00 and lasts about 95 minutes. The second class is the pre-class work I do for it, which I do on before my class. Since pre-class work has to happen before the class, the CS110 class task is dependent on the doing pre-class work. Besides that, I also plan on talk to my family since it has been quite a long time since I spoke to them last time due to a lot of obligations that I had. Of course, I also have breakfast and lunch, both being quite flexible, however, lunch has to happen after breakfast and I always take it after the CS110 class because it takes me around 80 minutes to make it and eat it, which is quite a lot of time. <br><br>\n",
    "Finally, this assignment allowed me to complete some of the tasks that I have been delaying for quite a long time. Even though I have been in Taiwan for almost 2 months now, I still haven't visited any night markets, despite them being on of the most famous tourist destinations. Luckily, Taipei has the largest Night market in Taiwan, called Shilin Night market, that has more than 500 food stalls and shops. Since it opens only in the evenings, I decided that I would visit it at exactly 19:30 because by then, most of the shops had to have been already open. Of course, I decided that I would devote nearly 4 hours to exploring it, which also includes the time to get there. Also, I decided that it could only happen after I had already eaten breakfast, taken class and had lunch.<br><br>\n",
    "I am a really big food lover and, thus, I planned to visit one of the most famous street restaurants in Taiwan, a small restaurant near the Shilling Market that has been making one particular meal - pork rib soup - for the last 40 years. The place is so famous that it has consistently, for the last decade, been awarded the Michelin star, and one of the items on my bucket list was to try a Michelin Star meal. I decided that this would be my reward that would come after finishing my tour of the Shilin market. <br><br>\n",
    "Finally, I also wanted to visit the Taipei 101, which is the tallest building in Taiwan and was the tallest building in the world for a long time. I heard from my friends that the night view of the city is stunning and I really wanted to visit. I planned to visit it after visitng the night market since I wanted it to be done late in the evening. "

However, calculating these priorities like this would be tremendously difficult and would necessitate other data structures such as graphs and algorithms such as topological sort.  <br><br>\n",

This is because fixed tasks have to be done at certain times, regardless of the situation with fixed tasks. Consequently, it is entirely possible that these tasks will have different priority values than the flexible tasks. Not only that, but it is much easier to keep account of what the next fixed task is if we keep them in a separate heap. This is tremendously useful since then we can easily know how much time we have left for flexible tasks before we have to do the next fixed task. This would be more difficult and time inefficient in a single heap since we would have to traverse it to find the next one. Another problem that could arise with a single heap is, unless rewards are perfectly calculated, that there could still be flexible tasks that have higher priority than the next fixed tasks even though the fixed tasks has to happen soon or even now."

    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    ">The scheduler proved exceptionally useful. As someone who likes to prioritize doing as many tasks as possible in a day, the scheduler helped me accomplish exactly that, so that at the end of the day I found myself looking back and realized that all of the tasks have been completed.<br><br>\n",
    "What was even more remarkable for me was that, since I strictly followed the times devoted to each task, I actually find myself having free spaces inbetween tasks. For example, the break between finishing pre-class work and the class or making and eating lunch and visiting the Shilin market. This was such pleasant surprise for me and something that literally never happens to me. Since I usually do not have strictly defined times for tasks, I never have time to relax and enjoy the free spaces inbetween tasks because I just keep doing a task until its necessary to do the next one, which really stresses me out. Having these breaks allowed me to do some additional tasks that I didn't expect which is the first time in a long time where I did more than what was on my to-do list for the day, which is such an amazing feeling and I want to do it again!<br><br>\n",
    "Also, it significantly decreased the amount of time I spent on planning my day and the decision fatigue. I used to spend a lot of time planning my day, but with the scheduler, I was able to plan my day in a matter of minutes by just estimating how long each task should take (I overestimated on purpose to avoid not having enough time and have some time for unexpected tasks).<br><br>I also used to have a lot of decision fatigue because I would have to decide what to do next and when to stop because I would always feel behind, but with the scheduler, I was able to just follow the orders of the tasks and not have to worry about deciding myself, whilst being confident that everything will be accomplished in the correct order. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:** \n",
    "\n",
    ">However, there are several drawbacks that I think are possible.<br>\n",
    ">1. The algorithm and the schedule are generally quite rigid and it little room for spontaneity. Things can happen and we might have to change our plans quickly. Doing so, might make it a little difficult to do so with the scheduler. For example, if I suddentl had an emergency, I would have to change my schedule and I would have to do it manually. I would have to change the time of the tasks that I have already done and the time of the tasks that I have yet to do. This would be quite tedious with the schedule and even impossible if I don't have the program nearby. Maybe I also underestimated the duration of a task or I would like to spend more time at the Shilin Market because I found something awesome, now all other tasks would be pushed and it would be tedious to rearrange the schedule.<br><br>\n",
    ">2. From another perspective, the fact that algorithm leaves free time spots might not always be an advantage. Perhaps we have a large backlog and we want to get as much done as possible. In this case, we would want to fill up all the time slots with tasks. However, this is an easy fix and we can just feed the backlog tasks too. <br><br>\n",
    ">3. One could potentially want an additionally importance attributed. For example, there might be a task that irrelevant to its length or the number of dependencies has to be done. The code does not currently support this. However, this is also an easy fix and we can just add another attribute to the task class and add it to the priority calculation function. Generally, the code I have written is really easy to maintain and upgrade to be more sophisticated.<br><br>\n",
    ">4. Sometimes it is possible to do multiple tasks at the same time. For example, if I had a task of travelling to Jiunfen, I could, at the same time, talk to my family. This is currently not supported but is a feature that can be easily added.<br><br>\n",
    ">5. Another drawback is that it has no day end time by which tasks should be done. I did this purposely because it reflects how I usually go about my obligations. As a workaholic, I like to do as much as possible and try to finish as many of my tasks as possible, which can mean that I am flexible and often stay up very late or even pull all-nighters. However, this is not sustainable and it might be a habit I would want to change. In that case, it would be useful to have a certain set time by which I have to go to bed (e.g. 02:30 AM) and we can only complete tasks up until this time. This is quite a simple feature to implement and I would be happy to do so if I had more time. At the moment, someone could enter a lot of tasks that last for a very long time and the scheduler would suggest an order where you would be working constantly, unless you put a break or sleep task (a simple fix).<br><br>\n",
    ">6. It might not be the most optimal when it comes to things that require travelling because in these cases it does not take into account the time it takes to travel or the distance. For example, it could have suggested that I go to the Taipei 101 after the Night Market even though the street food is much closer. Incorporating the functionality of this would significantly increase complexity and would in part be a travelling salesman problem. However, the scheduler works for tasks that are close to each other.<br><br>\n",
    ">7. If a fixed task has dependencies that are too long, as in, the can not be completed before the fixed task starts, the scheduler will suggest that the person starts the task regardlessly, which makes sense since I sometimes can't always fully finish the preclasswork before class but I still want to start and do as much as possible. The only problem is that the output can be nicened a bit but that's a cosmetic issue, the feature is there and it works!\n",
    "\n",
    ">Overall, the code is really efficient as it suggests a schedule that is optimal in terms of the number of things that I can accomplish in a day which is the essentially the only metric that I care about and follow perosnally. Others might have different metrics that they care about and the code can be easily modified to accomodate for that."

    ">In my day, the scheduler successfuly suggested an order where all tasks are completed, meaning that it was absolutely successful!<br><br>In example 7. of the limitations, I mentioned that the scheduler would suggest that I start a task even if it can't be completed before the fixed task starts. However, if we know that we can't complete the dependency before the fixed tasks, instead of starting it, we might want to want to use the time to do as many other tasks thus prioritizing the quantity of tasks completed. I did not do this in this case, but it is a simple feature. <br><br> Bear in mind, it is not really a problem of the scheduler that it suggests that I start a task that I can't finish before the fixed task starts, it is more so the user's problem for not thinking about their plan in due time. Consequently, the scheduler is still extremely efficient. <br><br>"

    "> As we can see, the runtime has *quadratic scaling growth* O(n^2). From a time complexity point, this is not really efficient, however, I would argue that we should not be looking at asymptotical scaling growth at all. We are only going to have a fixed number of tasks (most likely under 15) and the runtime is going to be very small. For example, even if we had 300 tasks, the runtime would be only 0.035 seconds which is not a problem at all! Inputting that many tasks and dependencies would take much, much longer. <br><br> \n",
    "> One interesting thing though would happen with the average runtime if we had the end-day timing feature that I discussed above. In that case, at some point, given relatively stable task durations, the runtime would plateau past a certain threshold of number of tasks. This is because there is only so much that we can do in time, meaning that even if we inputted a lot of tasks, the code would break out as soon as we filled our day.\n"

    ">As someone who likes to prioritize doing as many tasks as possible in a day, the scheduler helped me accomplish exactly that. It also reduced my stress by giving me breaks and removing the decision fatigue. I would use the scheduler for tasks that do not require moving, as the schedule doesn't account for the time it takes to travel or the distance, and when I know I won't have any spontaneous changes in the plan.<br><br>\n",
